# Changelog

## Vinx Scorza fork

<sub>Starting from `v0.3.2-vinx.1` (16 March 2026), this changelog includes changes specific to the Vinx Scorza fork. All entries below `v0.3.2-vinx.1` are inherited from the Mebitek fork history and are kept here as upstream reference. From the first standalone Vinx release onward, Vinx uses standalone semantic versioning (`v0.x.y`) while preserving the earlier `v0.3.2-vinx.*` entries as historical lineage. I try to preserve backward compatibility with older projects, settings, and workflows where possible, but I do not guarantee it for Vinx-specific changes.</sub>

# v0.4.5
- Add `Acid Eucl Phrase` as an Acid phrase workflow with Euclidean-shaped gate structure, integrated in machine UI and Launchpad Generators Mode.
- Harden `Routing` / CV target handling by classifying continuous, discrete, and boolean/trigger-like destinations more explicitly and rejecting incompatible target/track combinations more deterministically.
- Reduce SRAM pressure with conservative memory cleanup and keep simulator/web assets aligned with current firmware behavior.
- Fix crash-prone `Wreck Pattern` paths while preserving the preview/cancel/apply safety model.
- Keep project format unchanged (`Version40`), so existing `v0.4.4` projects remain readable.

# v0.4.4
- Align `Stochastic` and `Arp` pitch evaluation with selected scale/root when transpose is routed. Legacy bypass-scale slots are masked by musical scales, transpose behaves as register movement inside the selected scale/root, and explicit `Semitones` keeps chromatic legacy behavior.
- Make `Euclidean` parameter edits immediately committable: editing `Offset`, `Steps`, or `Beats` now arms and displays a valid preview, so `Apply` can write the sequence without a separate `NEW EUCL` reroll.
- Make `Random` more musical on the Note layer without adding parameters: `Range` behaves as a note-window span around the current register, `Bias` shifts that center lower/higher, and generated values use a more center-weighted curve; non-note layers keep the historical generic mapping.
- Harden `Chaos` / `Wreck Pattern` memory behavior by keeping generator backup storage out of persistent UI/CCMRAM pressure; this preserves `A/B`, `Cancel`, and `Apply` while avoiding reboot-prone growth when entering Note/System pages.
- Harden project `LOAD` browsing on SD: `FileManager` now caches slot info, initializes empty slot names safely, and feeds the watchdog around STM32 slot reads, reducing reboot risk when entering or scrolling `LOAD` with many project files.

# v0.4.3
- Rework `Chaos` / `Entropy` interaction safety: editing `target` / `selection` / `amount` no longer auto-regenerates preview; reroll stays explicit on `CHAOS` (`F3`) and `APPLY` is blocked in `ORIGINAL` state (`PRESS CHAOS`)
- Add persistent `Chaos` register controls in context: `Pivot` / `Span` are now available during `Chaos` editing and retained across sessions
- Add per-track `Gate Out Mode` (`Gate` / `Trigger`) on `Note` / `Curve` / `Stochastic` / `Logic` / `Arp`, plus global `Trigger Length` in `System -> User Settings` (per-track behavior, not per-step)
- Harden project file operations (`Load` / `Save` / `Save As`) by serializing file tasks, rejecting overlapping requests deterministically, and dispatching task results on UI thread; add busy-state feedback in slot lists during active file operations (strong partial hardening, not full architectural closure)
- Add quick-access bank paging for step-range fields: while holding `PAGE`, `PREV` / `NEXT` now moves `16-step` banks (`1-16`, `17-32`, `33-48`, `49-64`) for `First Step` / `Last Step` and `Seq First Step` / `Seq Last Step`
- Make Note tie editing chain-aware: persistent tie-chain state, note propagation across tied steps (encoder, MIDI note input, shortcut note input), and clearer tie rendering in step view
- Fix Project-level scale remap octave collapse: changing Project `Scale` now preserves octave register on Note tracks using `Scale = Default` (`noteToVolts -> noteFromVolts` remap path), with dedicated regression coverage
- Improve SD boot robustness on slower cards: increase SD init tolerance (`ACMD41` timeout), feed watchdog during long init waits, and keep runtime watchdog strict for normal recovery behavior
- Clarify context-dependent shortcut behavior in docs and reference tables: machine `PAGE + S7` is `Undo/Redo` on `Note` / `Curve` / `Logic` step pages, and loop toggle on `Stochastic`

# v0.4.2
- Align `Random` `Variation` semantics with `Acid`: `Variation` now behaves as a per-step keep/replace control against the original material in both generators
- Clamp `Chaos` `Note` and `Note Range` generation to a `-24..+24` semitone window (4 octaves total)
- Make all generators enter on `ORIGINAL`; the first generated preview now requires an explicit reroll action
- Rework generator footer/context layouts for a more uniform workflow across `Random`, `Acid Layer`, `Acid Phrase`, `Euclidean`, and `Chaos`
- Fix `Voltage Mode` octave behavior on `Arp` and `Stochastic` so octave wrapping follows the intended `1.2V` octave span (`0.1V` semitone grid)

# v0.4.1
- Add experimental `16-step Editing Mode` (`Launch Control XL` + `BeatStep Pro` profile) with explicit armed/disarmed entry, forced visible 16-step loop while armed, bank navigation and loop-range restore on exit, plus controller feedback on `LCXL/BSP` (gate-pad LEDs and prev/next function-button feedback; knob-row LED behavior remains device-local). Compatibility is map-driven: any controller can work if it sends the expected MIDI map on channel `9`
- Fix Performer `GEN` menu flow/labels by track type: on `Note` use explicit `Acid (Layer/Phrase)` and `Chaos (Vandalize/Wreck)` labels; on non-Note tracks expose `Chaos (Entropy)` (`ChaosEntropy` mode)
- Fix `Voltage Mode` behavior on `Arp` and `Stochastic` tracks so non-chromatic user scales are respected in bypass-scale paths instead of forcing semitone/chromatic fallback
- Extend Launchpad `Generators Mode` beyond Note tracks: keep the full Note map (`GRID 1/2/10/3/11/4/8/16` = `Random`, `Acid Layer`, `Acid Phrase`, `Vandalize`, `Wreck`, `Euclidean`, `Init Layer`, `Init Steps`) and add the dedicated non-Note subset on `Curve` / `Stochastic` / `Logic` / `Arp` (`GRID 1/3/4/8/16` = `Random`, `Entropy`, `Euclidean`, `Init Layer`, `Init Steps`)
- Set `Slide Time` default to `10%` across track families (from the previous `20%` line default)
- Make user scales use dynamic names in all `Scale` menus; default user-scale slot names are now `INIT1`..`INIT4`

# v0.4.0
- Versioning transition: this release drops the inherited `v0.3.2-vinx.*` naming and starts standalone Vinx semantic versioning (`v0.x.y`)
- Memory footprint improved versus upstream baseline: static SRAM and CCRAM usage are significantly reduced compared to Mebitek 0.3.2
- Launchpad refactor: complete the P1 structural split of Launchpad controller domains (high-risk area hardening)
- Extend Launchpad `Generators Mode` beyond Note tracks: keep the full Note map unchanged, and add a dedicated subset on `Curve` / `Stochastic` / `Logic` / `Arp` (`GRID 1 = Random`, `GRID 3 = Entropy`, `GRID 4 = Euclidean`, `GRID 16 = Init Steps`)
- Add the new Chaos generator mode `Entropy` for non-Note Launchpad workflows, with Chaos-style interaction, dedicated target matrix, and persisted defaults in `System -> Chaos Defaults`
- Fix generator-selector track locking end-to-end: while the machine is inside the generator selector path (level 1 and deeper), Launchpad track/scene retarget is blocked so selection stays bound to the original track
- Fix generator-page retarget regressions by keeping Launchpad track/scene switching locked while generator pages are active
- From `Project`, `Layout`, `Routing`, `MIDI Output`, `User Scale`, and `Clock`, make track selection (`T1..8` on machine and `TRK1..8` on Launchpad) jump directly to `Steps` on the selected track
- Fix Launchpad Generators Mode UX regressions on hardware: stabilize overlay enter/exit behavior, keep selector mapping aligned
- Make `Init Steps` from Launchpad `Generators Mode` (`GRID 16`) apply immediately and exit the mode to plain `Steps`
- Add `TOP 7 + TOP 8` Launchpad undo shortcut on `Note` / `Curve` / `Logic` step-edit pages and make it a 1-level `Undo/Redo` toggle (same behavior as machine `PAGE + S7`)
- Make Generator commit from machine controls exit Launchpad `Generators Mode` cleanly to plain `Steps`, instead of returning to the LP overlay state
- Extend simulator regression coverage for Launchpad generator locking and selector flows, including explicit scene-switch lock checks for machine selector and generator pages and non-Note `Generators Mode` mapping/Init flows
- Harden STM32 clean-build reproducibility by resolving the ARM toolchain in a deterministic order (`repo tools` -> `TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` -> `PATH`) and by fixing an explicit `<algorithm>` include for `ClockTimer` (`std::min`) so from-scratch builds no longer depend on cache/toolchain accidents

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.5.2 (3 April 2026)
- Swap `Acid` mode order to `Layer` then `Phrase` in the machine `Acid` selector, and mirror that same swap in Launchpad `Generators Mode` (`GRID 2 = Acid Layer`, `GRID 10 = Acid Phrase`)
- Add `GRID 16 = Undo` to Launchpad `Generators Mode` (mirrors machine `PAGE + S7`): on generator preview pages it first reverts the current preview in its active scope (including `Wreck Pattern`), and outside preview pages it restores the selected Note-sequence snapshot; accidental `GRID 8` immediate `Init Steps` can therefore be reverted safely
- Align `Chaos` `ResetGen` with the other generators by keeping the current seed and current scope (`Vandalize` or `Wreck`) while resetting Chaos parameters
- Make Euclidean encoder rotation reroll (`NEW EUCL`) when no `F3/F4/F5` parameter key is held, while keeping `F3/F4/F5 + encoder` as direct `Steps/Beats/Offset` edits
- Harden `Init Layer` / `Init Steps` consistency across `Note`, `Stochastic`, `Arp`, `Curve`, and `Logic` step pages by centralizing the shared `selection-or-full-track` fallback used by generator init paths
- Add extra defensive context guards around `Acid` / `Chaos` generator entry from `Note` step edit flows, so those actions are ignored if the active track is no longer a `Note` track
- Harden Launchpad `Generators Mode` scene-key handling so track retargeting stays locked while the machine is inside the `Acid` / `Chaos` selector path
- Harden modal dispatch so if a selector/modal closes during key handling, the same event is no longer redispatched to the underlying page
- Add regression coverage in the simulator test harness for generator footer stability and selector cancel leak paths, and make existing project-page tests baseline-independent from simulator demo defaults

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.5.1
- Restore the `LP Note Style` machine-setting default to `Circuit`, so the firmware matches the current Launchpad documentation and intended fork workflow again
- Fix generator reset semantics so `Init Layer` on `Steps` remains layer-only, `Init Steps` in the `GEN` chooser is a real all-step-layers reset, and both now use the current persistent selection first or the whole current track when no selection exists
- Fix `Init Layer` / `Init Steps` behavior on `Stochastic` and `Arp`: `Init Layer` no longer clears full steps, `Arp` `Note` layer initialization restores its expected chromatic default, and `Init Steps` preserves the expected chromatic defaults for the first 12 note slots instead of flattening them through plain step clears
- Fix `Stochastic Init Seq` so sequence clear restores the intended low/high octave defaults deterministically again
- Fix generator footer navigation so switching between footer options in `Random`, `Acid`, and `Chaos` no longer exits the page unexpectedly
- Lock LP track switching while the machine is inside the `Acid` / `Chaos` selector path, so those modal choices stay bound to the current track until you cancel or confirm them on the machine
- Make encoder press commit the generator directly in `Random`, `Acid`, and `Euclidean`, so those pages can apply without reaching for `F5`

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.5.0 (2 April 2026)
- Refine the Chaos generator pages: rename the labels from CHAOS ON SEQ / CHAOS ON PAT to VNDLZ SEQ / WRECK PAT, and show the active seed in both Vandalize Sequence and Wreck Pattern while the untouched source still reads ORIGINAL
- Fix LP Note Style: Classic drawing on the Launchpad Note layer so non-home navigation positions light the edited note correctly instead of only updating the underlying step value
- Fix Stochastic -> Note Prob and Arp -> Note Launchpad handling so the dedicated Circuit keyboard/editor is used only when LP Note Style = Circuit, while Classic returns to the normal layer/navigation view
- Change the default LP Note Style machine setting from Classic to Circuit
- Make Launchpad input wake the display from the screensaver like panel input
- Fix Stochastic Circuit Keyboard probability and double-press targeting so 1..16 and note-toggle actions follow the actual selected note slot instead of drifting through stale octave-aware selection state
- Remove the non-editable derived Rest Prob display from the first Launchpad Rest Probability row, leaving only the editable Rest Prob 2 / 4 / 8 ranges
- Fix Launchpad behavior in Pattern, Performer, and Note Circuit Keyboard: edited Arp patterns are shown again in Pattern, Performer TOP 7 + TRK fills are released correctly, and Note Circuit Keyboard step editing now matches the documented 1..16 range
- Add an experimental Launchpad Generators Mode for Note tracks in LP Sequence mode: TOP 8 + TOP 4 jumps to Steps when needed and toggles the mode, GRID 1 / 2 / 10 / 3 / 11 / 4 / 8 select Random, Acid Phrase, Acid Layer, Vandalize, Wreck, Euclidean, and Init Steps, pressing the currently selected generator pad rerolls it in place, and TOP 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 map to A/B, ResetGen, Cancel, and Apply
- Refine Launchpad Generators Mode feedback and routing so TOP 5 distinguishes A / B, TOP 6 distinguishes reset-neutral from generated/edited state, unmapped GRID pads and TOP 1..3 stay neutral, TRK 1..8 can retarget the mode to another Note track, and off-context controls no longer trap the user until Cancel, Apply, or the mode toggle
- Fix remaining modal selector regressions introduced by modal redispatch so Confirmation, File Select, and Chaos Defaults no longer leak key presses to the underlying page when they close or ignore non-context keys
- Remove stray #include <iostream> usage from the STM32 sequencer code so the firmware no longer drags in the full iostream / locale runtime, recovering a large amount of flash and SRAM
- Clean up minor simulator build warnings by replacing boolean bitwise | usage in ListPage / QuickEditPage and removing an unused ArpTrackEngine field
- Replace the VersionedSerializedReader variable-length skip buffer with fixed-size chunked reads, removing the remaining Clang VLA warning in simulator builds
- Rework the Launchpad cheatsheet/doc site into a split Reference + tables format and update the manual/cheatsheet wording around LP Note Style, Stochastic Circuit Keyboard, Arp Circuit Keyboard, and Launchpad-specific workflows

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.9 (31 March 2026)
- Refine external clock input behavior by adding `Reset Pulse` as a new mode alongside `Reset Gate`, `Run`, and `Start/Stop`, and make it respond only to the rising edge so reset pulses resync the slave clock without turning the falling edge into an implicit start
- Add per-step `Gate Offset` and `Gate Length` layers to `Curve` tracks, including edit-page, overview, and Python bindings support
- Fix `Curve`-track entry and Launchpad handling when the new `Gate Offset` or `Gate Length` layers are selected
- Restore `PAGE + S7` undo on `Curve` step editing so it matches the existing Note-track edit workflow
- Rework machine-settings save flow: add direct `F2 = SAVE` on `System` for both `Calibration` and `Settings`, simplify the context menu to `Init`, `Backup`, and `Restore`, return `Chaos Defaults` to the normal save path, and prompt to save when leaving `System -> Settings` or leaving the `System` page after user-setting changes while keeping `Calibration` outside that check
- Add `Menu Wrap` as an on-by-default machine preference for cyclic list navigation
- Fix scale selector limits across `Project`, `Note`, `Logic`, `Stochastic`, and `Arp`
- Make MIDI note capture respect the active scale octave span in `Note`, `Stochastic`, and `Arp`
- Change the Launchpad defaults to `LP Style = Blue` and `LP Note Style = Classic`
- Turn the Desktop Simulator into a more usable MIDI/Launchpad tool: make DIN and USB MIDI ports configurable from the command line, start with MIDI disabled by default, add DIN/USB status indicators plus `--trace-midi` and `--trace-dio`, infer the connected Launchpad model from USB port names, and mirror sibling `DAW` / `MIDI` ports so Launchpad pad presses and initialization messages still reach the correct endpoint
- Current validation scope: real hardware testing is still useful for `Reset Pulse` / `Reset Gate` and for `Voltage Mode` user scales in `Note`, `Arp`, and `Stochastic`; Desktop Simulator USB MIDI is validated well on `macOS / OS X` with `Launchpad Mini MK3`, but not yet across other Launchpads or operating systems

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.8
- Extend `Chaos` with an experimental `CHAOS MODE` split between `Vandalize Sequence` and `Wreck Pattern`, with `Wreck Pattern` applying a multi-layer, pattern-wide workflow across all Note tracks in the current pattern
- Refine the `Chaos` workflow so both modes enter on `ORIGINAL`, require an explicit `CHAOS` press, support `A/B` preview compare, show dedicated `VANDALIZED` / `WRECKED` popups, and use per-track `First Step` / `Last Step` ranges when `Wreck Pattern` runs without an explicit selection
- Add `System -> Chaos Defaults` with separate `Seq Layers to Vandalize` and `Pat Layers to Wreck`, edited through the same 4x4 grid and auto-saved on page close
- Refine the wider generator workflow: add stronger contextual labels (`ACID PHRASE`, `ACID LAYER`, `CHAOS ON SEQ`, `CHAOS ON PAT`), fit the generator selector on one screen, rework `Euclidean` around `A/B`, `NEW EUCL`, and direct `Steps` / `Beats` / `Offset` editing with `Beats <= Steps` enforced, and make `RESETGEN` restore neutral defaults instead of rerolling
- Improve stability, memory use, and responsiveness around generator handling: keep transport (`PLAY/STOP`, `TEMPO`) active during generator use, default `System` to `Settings`, resolve generator re-entry and stale-state issues, limit `Vandalize Sequence` storage to the active Note sequence, and reduce `Wreck Pattern` memory usage by storing only target-step backups and regenerating previews in place
- Add a warning popup before entering `Chaos -> Wreck Pattern` (`F1` = `PROJ PAGE`, `F3` = `WRECK`, `F5` = cancel) and keep it explicitly marked as a wildly experimental pattern-wide process that should be used only after saving the project

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.7 (25 March 2026)
- Add `Chaos` as a new experimental Note-track generator, extending the generator order to `Random`, `Acid`, `Chaos`, `Euclidean`, `Init`, and define it as a non-destructive multi-layer macro-random tool driven by `Amount`, `A/B`, `Cancel`, `Apply`, and a new on-demand 32-bit seed
- Give `Chaos` its own 4x4 layer matrix with direct `All On` / `All Off` controls, and make it selection-aware like the other generators by targeting the persistent selection first and falling back to the current `First Step` / `Last Step` window
- Add Chaos-specific compare messaging so `A/B` flips between `ORIGINAL` and `VANDALIZED` while keeping the standard preview/apply safety model intact
- Refine Note-like step visualization again by moving retrigger marks into the step box, adding a compact condition mark next to the step number, and rendering slide as a small tie between adjacent step boxes
- Refine defaults and workflow around the wider line: set the screensaver default to `15m`, add `Wake Mode = required`, restore the correct `Init Layer` behavior while clarifying `Init Layer` vs `Init Steps`, and refresh the built-in simulator state and browser audio mapping

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.6 (24 March 2026)
- Reduce UI/display overhead by lowering the default refresh rate to `30 fps` and skipping display redraws when the framebuffer hash has not changed, avoiding unnecessary display traffic without adding a second framebuffer
- Add immediate `Scale` prelisten preview on Note and Arp sequence pages, while keeping commit on encoder press and adding `CANCEL` to `Scale` and `Root Note` editing so preview changes can be discarded safely
- Refine defaults and cleanup around sequencing/generators: set `Slide Time` to `20%` by default where available, remove the duplicate `Euclidean` entry from non-Note generator menus, and clean dead `PatternPage` allocation code
- Recover RAM headroom and refresh the simulator state by disabling `Task Profiler` and the `Asteroids` easter egg in active builds, then updating the bundled simulator/browser demo setup with a revised Track 8 synth voice and drum sample set

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.5 (22 March 2026)
- Refine generator preview rendering on the display: make the 16-step bank indicator thinner and framed, slim down the playback playhead, improve `Random` preview rendering, and align `Acid` `Slide` / `Phrase` note and slide lanes more cleanly
- Make `Random` preview layer-aware on Note tracks, reusing `Acid`-style Gate / Note / Slide visuals where they fit, adding dedicated views for Length and repeat-style layers, and reorder the `F4` Note layer cycle to `Note`, `Slide`, `Note Range`, `Note Prob`, `Bypass Scale`

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.4 (22 March 2026)
- Redesign generator previews on the display: `Random` now uses a centered 64-step baseline graph, `Acid` gets dedicated Note / Gate / Slide / Phrase preview layouts, and generator pages keep the current 16-step bank visible within the full 64-step view with a playback-following playhead

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.3 (21 March 2026)
- Add `Acid` as a new Note-track generator with non-destructive preview and a `Layer / Phrase` split: `Acid -> Layer` targets the active `Gate`, `Note`, or `Slide` layer, while `Acid -> Phrase` writes a coordinated `Gate + Note + Slide` phrase over the current selection or pattern length
- Refine generator defaults and menus: make `Range` displays consistently percentage-based, randomize parameters on entry while keeping `Variation = 100%`, tighten `Acid` `Density` / `Slide` behavior around deterministic target counts, reorder the generator menu to `Random`, `Acid`, `Euclidean`, `Init`, keep `Random Bias = 0` on entry, and trim `Acid -> Layer` to layer-relevant parameters
- Rework `NEW RAND` behavior so it differs from encoder seed edits: in `Random` it refreshes `Seed`, `Smooth`, and `Range` while leaving `Bias` untouched; in `Acid -> Layer` it refreshes `Seed` plus the active layer’s main parameter without touching `Variation`, and the same action is mirrored on `F5` for quicker access

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.2 (20 March 2026)
- Expand `Dim Sequence` from a binary toggle to `off`, `dim`, and `dim+`, defaulting to `dim` to better tame display noise leaking into the audio band

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4.1 (20 March 2026)
- Remove the small step markers between step numbers in Note and Logic step views
- Restore Random `Variation` to `100%` by default

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.4 (19 March 2026)
- Rework `Generate -> Random` around full 32-bit hexadecimal seeds, automatic seed refresh on entry and seed edits, cleaner `NEW SEED` / `INIT` / `CANCEL` / `APPLY` flow, and `F1 = A/B` compare between `ORIGINAL` and `CURRENT SEED`
- Refine Random generator behavior and preview stability: keep `Seed` stable while editing other parameters, make `Variation` update the preview on the display correctly, and set the default `Variation` to `50%` with clearer A/B seed-slot feedback
- Improve generator/page navigation by opening `Generate` on the current 16-step bank and making its LEDs and `prev` / `next` bank navigation follow that bank
- Refine defaults and visuals across the sequencer: set `Reset CV` to `Off`, return `Dim Sequence` to `Off`, improve step visualization for gate offset / length / retrigger, and further refine retrigger alignment in step rendering

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.3 (18 March 2026)
- Rework `Generate -> Random` around a non-destructive preview workflow with `A/B`, `Regenerate`, `Cancel`, `Apply`, and the new `Variation` parameter for controlled deviation from the original sequence
- Reorder the generator menu to `Random`, `Euclidean`, `Init`, and make `prev` / `next` sequence navigation wrap according to the current sequence length

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.2 (17 March 2026)
- With "Dim Sequence" enabled, step LEDs are slightly dimmed, which may help reduce electrical noise and interference. This option is now enabled by default.

# v0.3.2-vinx.1.1 (17 March 2026)
- Change the default output clock pulse from 1ms to 10ms for broader module compatibility
- Rescale the Swing UI from 50%-75% to 0%-99% while keeping the engine timing unchanged at 50%-75%, so older projects retain the same playback behavior

# v0.3.2-vinx.1 (16 March 2026)
- Fix step-shifting stability and range handling across note, logic, curve, stochastic, and arp sequences
- This includes the 64-step crash/reboot case and selected-step shifts inside non-zero subranges

## v0.1.11 (3 Apr 2019)

This release is mostly adding support for additional launchpad devices. However, while testing I unfortunately found that the hardware might have an issue on the USB power supply (in fact there is quite some ripple on the internal 5V power rail) leading to spurious resets of the launchpad. Connecting the launchpad through an externally powered USB hub seems to fix the issue. Therefore it is beneficial to run the launchpad with dimmed leds (default). For now, the brightness can be adjusted by pressing `8` + `6` on the launchpad. I will investigate the hardware issue as soon as possible.
