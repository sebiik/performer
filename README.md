PER|FORMER is a eurorack sequencer module designed for both live performance and work in the studio.
This firmware is a personal fork of the <a href="https://github.com/mebitek/performer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mebitek fork</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/westlicht/performer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original Westlicht PER|FORMER firmware</a>, shaped by real performance use, custom behavior, and focused interaction and UI changes.

## Major Features

- `Generators & Performance Workflow`: `Random`, `Euclidean`, `Acid`, and `Chaos` form a broader generator ecosystem built around preview/apply safety, `A/B` comparison, explicit reroll behavior, and live-performance use. `Acid` includes `Layer`, `Phrase`, and `Eucl Phrase`; `Chaos` expands into `Vandalize`, `Wreck`, and non-Note `Entropy`.
- `Launchpad`: Launchpad is treated as a first-class performance layer, with Generators Mode, Init actions, Undo/Redo, safer cancel/apply behavior, and track-aware mappings across Note and non-Note tracks.
- `Step Editing, Timing & Sequencing`: External `16-step Editing Mode` adds direct note/gate editing for Note tracks with 16-knob + 16-pad controllers. Core sequencing also gained bank-aware range editing, chain-aware note ties, Curve gate timing layers, per-track `Gate/Trigger` output behavior, tighter clock/reset handling, and improved scale/Voltage Mode behavior.
- `Core Engine & Safety`: Generator and modal UI paths were hardened against wrong-target apply/cancel behavior, stale state, and controller retargeting edge cases. Routing/CV control now treats continuous, discrete, and trigger-like targets more safely and filters writes by compatible track mode.
- `Reliability & Runtime`: STM32 memory pressure was reduced, heavy generator paths were hardened, and `Load` / `Save` / `Save As`, project browsing, and slower SD-card boot paths were improved to reduce race and reboot-prone behavior.
- `Docs, Site & Simulator`: The website separates roles clearly: Home for overview, Features for the curated feature map, User Manual for practical use, Build Guide for hardware/build/simulator setup, and Cheatsheet for Launchpad reference. The online manual includes search/navigation and a printable PDF.

Known limits and current validation notes are tracked in the <a href="https://vinxscorza.github.io/performer/manual/#manual-validation-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Manual validation section</a>.
For the exact technical chronology, including inherited upstream history, see <a href="CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHANGELOG</a>.

If you are looking for a more conservative upstream baseline, you may prefer the original Westlicht or Mebitek lines. If you are interested in a more hands-on, performance-oriented evolution of PER|FORMER, this fork aims to be a solid machine for live performance, but also a crazy one for experimentation.

I am very grateful to Simon Kallweit for creating and developing the original Westlicht PER|FORMER. Free software should stay free in the sense of user freedom, but free as in freedom does not mean free labor. If this fork gives you value, consider supporting the work behind it:<br>

## Overview

This repository contains the firmware for the **PER|FORMER** eurorack sequencer.

For more information on the project go <a href="https://westlicht.github.io/performer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

The hardware design files are hosted in a separate repository <a href="https://github.com/westlicht/performer-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## Development

If you want to do development on the firmware, the following is a quick guide on how to setup the development environment to get you going.

### Setup on macOS and Linux

First you have to clone this repository (make sure to add the `--recursive` option to also clone all the submodules):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VinxScorza/performer.git
```

After cloning, enter the performer directory:

```
cd performer
```

### STM32 Toolchain Resolution (Vinx note)

For STM32 builds, the toolchain file now resolves `arm-none-eabi` tools in this order:

1. `tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi/bin` inside this repository
2. `TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` (CMake variable or environment variable, expected to point to the directory containing `arm-none-eabi-*`)
3. system `PATH`

This keeps clean builds deterministic across machines while still allowing explicit overrides.

Make sure you have a recent version of CMake installed. If you are on Linux, you might also want to install a few other packages. For Debian based systems, use:

```
sudo apt-get install libtool autoconf cmake libusb-1.0.0-dev libftdi-dev pkg-config
```

To compile for the hardware and allow flashing firmware you have to install the ARM toolchain and build OpenOCD:

```
make tools_install
```

Next, you have to setup the build directories:

```
make setup_stm32
```

If you also want to compile/run the simulator use:

```
make setup_sim
```

The simulator is great when developing new features. It allows for a faster development cycle and a better debugging experience.

### Setup on Windows

Currently, there is no native support for compiling the firmware on Windows. As a workaround, there is a Vagrantfile to allow setting up a Vagrant virtual machine running Linux for compiling the application.

First you have to clone this repository (make sure to add the `--recursive` option to also clone all the submodules):

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/VinxScorza/performer.git
```

Next, go to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html</a> and download the latest Vagrant release. Once installed, use the following to setup the Vagrant machine:

```
cd performer
vagrant up
```

This will take a while. When finished, you have a virtual machine ready to go. To open a shell, use the following:

```
vagrant ssh
```

When logged in, you can follow the development instructions below, everything is now just the same as with a native development environment on macOS or Linux. The only difference is that while you have access to all the source code on your local machine, you use the virtual machine for compiling the source.

To stop the virtual machine, log out of the shell and use:

```
vagrant halt
```

You can also remove the virtual machine using:

```
vagrant destroy
```

### Build directories

After successfully setting up the development environment you should now have a list of build directories found under `build/[stm32|sim]/[release|debug]`. The `release` targets are used for compiling releases (more code optimization, smaller binaries) whereas the `debug` targets are used for compiling debug releases (less code optimization, larger binaries, better debugging support).

### Developing for the hardware

You will typically use the `release` target when building for the hardware. So you first have to enter the release build directory:

```
cd build/stm32/release
```

To compile everything, simply use:

```
make -j
```

Using the `-j` option is generally a good idea as it enables parallel building for faster build times.

To compile individual applications, use the following make targets:

- `make -j sequencer` - Main sequencer application
- `make -j sequencer_standalone` - Main sequencer application running without bootloader
- `make -j bootloader` - Bootloader
- `make -j tester` - Hardware tester application
- `make -j tester_standalone` - Hardware tester application running without bootloader

Building a target generates a list of files. For example, after building the sequencer application you should find the following files in the `src/apps/sequencer` directory relative to the build directory:

- `sequencer` - ELF binary (containing debug symbols)
- `sequencer.bin` - Raw binary
- `sequencer.hex` - Intel HEX file (for flashing)
- `sequencer.srec` - Motorola SREC file (for flashing)
- `sequencer.list` - List file containing full disassembly
- `sequencer.map` - Map file containing section/offset information of each symbol
- `sequencer.size` - Size file containing size of each section

If compiling the sequencer, an additional `UPDATE.DAT` file is generated which can be used for flashing the firmware using the bootloader.

To simplify flashing an application to the hardware during development, each application has an associated `flash` target. For example, to flash the bootloader followed by the sequencer application use:

```
make -j flash_bootloader
make -j flash_sequencer
```

Flashing to the hardware is done using OpenOCD. By default, this expects an Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H JTAG to be attached to the USB port. You can easily reconfigure this to use a different JTAG by editing the `OPENOCD_INTERFACE` variable in the `src/platform/stm32/CMakeLists.txt` file. Make sure to change both occurrences. A list of available interfaces can be found in the `tools/openocd/share/openocd/scripts/interface` directory (or `/home/vagrant/tools/openocd/share/openocd/scripts/interface` when running the virtual machine).

### Developing for the simulator

Note that the simulator is only supported on macOS and Linux and does not currently run in the virtual machine required on Windows.

You will typically use the `debug` target when building for the simulator. So you first have to enter the debug build directory:

```
cd build/sim/debug
```

To compile everything, simply use:

```
make -j
```

To run the simulator, use the following:

```
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer
```

Note that you have to start the simulator from the build directory in order for it to find all the assets.

Desktop simulator MIDI can be configured from the command line. Use `./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --midi` to list available ports, then launch with options such as:

```
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --midi-port "Your MIDI Port"
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --midi-in "Your Keyboard In" --midi-out "Your Synth Out"
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --usb-midi-port "Your Launchpad Port"
```

By default, the Desktop Simulator now starts with both DIN MIDI and USB MIDI disabled, so it does not try to open missing macOS MIDI devices unless you explicitly assign them.
Use `--trace-midi` to inspect incoming simulator MIDI messages and `--trace-dio` if you want terminal output for the simulated `CLK OUT` and `RESET OUT` digital lines.

Use `none`, `off`, or `-` to disable a default input or output assignment, for example:

```
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --midi-out none
```

On macOS, some devices expose port directions from the device point of view instead of the simulator point of view. For example, a Launchpad Mini MK3 on the simulated USB MIDI port may need:

```
./src/apps/sequencer/sequencer --usb-midi-in "Launchpad Mini MK3 LPMiniMK3 DAW Out" --usb-midi-out "Launchpad Mini MK3 LPMiniMK3 DAW In"
```

In the current Vinx setup, the simulator-side USB MIDI workflow has only been validated on macOS / OS X with a `Launchpad Mini MK3`, since that is the only Launchpad currently available for local testing.
The simulator now also infers the Launchpad model from the selected USB port names, so a Mini MK3 is no longer exposed to the firmware as the old Mini Mk2 default device.
For Launchpad-style USB controllers, the simulator also mirrors both the matching sibling input and output ports (`DAW` / `MIDI`) when possible, so pad presses and initialization messages can still land on the endpoint the device actually uses.

### Source code directory structure

The following is a quick overview of the source code directory structure:

- `src` - Top level source directory
- `src/apps` - Applications
- `src/apps/bootloader` - Bootloader application
- `src/apps/hwconfig` - Hardware configuration files
- `src/apps/sequencer` - Main sequencer application
- `src/apps/tester` - Hardware tester application
- `src/core` - Core library used by both the sequencer and hardware tester application
- `src/libs` - Third party libraries
- `src/os` - Shared OS helpers
- `src/platform` - Platform abstractions
- `src/platform/sim` - Simulator platform
- `src/platform/stm32` - STM32 platform
- `src/test` - Test infrastructure
- `src/tests` - Unit and integration tests

The two platforms both have a common subdirectories:

- `drivers` - Device drivers
- `libs` - Third party libraries
- `os` - OS abstraction layer
- `test` - Test runners

The main sequencer application has the following structure:

- `asteroids` - Asteroids game (disabled in active builds)
- `engine` - Engine responsible for running the sequencer core
- `model` - Data model storing the live state of the sequencer and many methods to change that state
- `python` - Python bindings for running tests using python
- `tests` - Python based tests
- `ui` - User interface
